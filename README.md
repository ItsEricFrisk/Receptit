## Description

This web application utilizes AI to extract, structure, and translate recipes from images. Users can upload a photo of a recipe, and the app automatically processes the text using OCR (Tesseract.js) and AI (OpenAI) to deliver a well-structured recipe with clear ingredients and instructions.

## Key Features

* Image to Text Extraction – Uses Tesseract.js to extract text from recipe images.
* AI-Powered Recipe Structuring – Removes unnecessary text, identifies ingredients, and organizes instructions.
* Automatic Translation – Converts recipes into Swedish for consistency and clarity.
* Seamless User Experience – A simple and intuitive interface for fast and efficient recipe conversion.

## How It Works

1. Upload an image containing a recipe.
2. The app extracts the text using OCR (Tesseract.js).
3. AI processes the text, filtering out irrelevant information.
4. The structured recipe, including ingredients and step-by-step instructions, is returned in Swedish.
